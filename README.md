Schnapsen played entirely via console.

It's played by styrian rules with just one player against an algorithm

After entering your name, the game immediately fetches the trump.
Then it decides whose turn it is. 
So either you get to be the dealer or not your options are limited.

Dealer:
1-5: throw card
6: Call Pairs
7: Change the Trump Card
8: Block the deck
9: bet on ending the Game and start counting!

Translation:

1-5: deal a card the machine has to respond to 

6: if you have the King&Queen of the same coat you are allowed to gain 20 or even 40 points depending on the trump card

7: If you have the prince of the same coat as the trump card you may switch it

8: nobody is allowed to draw cards anymore. Game ends when all cards in hand are played

9: you end the Game prematurely, if you are above 65 points you win, if not then you lose regardless your opponents score.


Not being the Dealer:

1-5: throw card

6-9: these actions cannot be accessed

Translation:

1-5: the cards of the same Coat are highlighted, but you are allowed to throw any card in your hand.
if you win the table you become the current dealer


The Game ends if either one player ends the Game as Dealer or all Cards in hands are thrown.
if the Dealer end prematurely, then he has to have a score > 65 to win.
if all available cards are played, the one with the higher score wins.

May the forc...ehm...believe in the heart of the car...ehm...GOOD LUCK!
